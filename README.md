### 💼 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in machine learning, backend and frontend systems, and building meaningful software that solves real-world problems. I enjoy working across the stack and bringing ideas to life — whether it’s a web app that improves everyday services or an ML model that adds intelligence to automation.
